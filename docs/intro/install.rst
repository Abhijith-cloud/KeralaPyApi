Install Guide
=============

Being a Python library, **KeralaPyApi** requires Python to be installed in your system.
We recommend using the latest versions of both Python 3 and pip.

- Get **Python 3** from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (or with your package manager)
- Get **pip** by following the instructions at https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/.

.. important::

    KeralaPyApi supports **Python 3** only, starting from version 3.5.3. **PyPy** is supported too.

Install KeralaPyApi
-------------------

-   The easiest way to install and upgrade KeralaPyApi to its latest stable version is by using **pip**:

    .. code-block:: text

        $ pip3 install -U KeralaPyApi


Bleeding Edge
-------------

Keralapyapi is always evolving, although new releases on PyPI are published only when enough changes are added, but this
doesn't mean you can't try new features right now!

In case you'd like to try out the latest KeralaPyApi features, the `GitHub repo` is always kept updated with new changes;
you can install the development version straight from the ``development`` branch using this command (note "development.zip" in
the link):

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip3 install -U https://github.com/KeralaPyApi/KeralaPyApi/archive/development.zip
